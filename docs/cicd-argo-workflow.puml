title "Staging Deployment CI/CD Pipeline via Argo Workflows State Diagram"

' Define states
state IDLE : System is idle, waiting for actions
state WORKFLOW_PENDING_START : PR created, waiting for workflow start
state WORKFLOW_STARTING : Argo Workflows starting workflow
state PR_POLICY_CHECKING : Argo Workflows checking PR policy
state PR_POLICY_FAILED : PR policy check failed
state PR_POLICY_PASSED : PR policy check passed
state UNIT_TESTS_RUNNING : GitHub Actions running unit tests (triggered by Argo Workflows)
state UNIT_TESTS_FAILED : Unit tests failed
state INTEGRATION_TESTS_RUNNING : GitHub Actions running integration tests (triggered by Argo Workflows)
state INTEGRATION_TESTS_FAILED : Integration tests failed
state TESTS_PASSED : All tests passed
state IMAGE_PUBLISHING : GitHub Actions publishing Docker image
state DEPLOYMENT_PENDING : Argo CD detecting new image
state DEPLOYMENT_IN_PROGRESS : Argo CD deploying new version
state DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESSFUL : Deployment completed successfully
state BA_TESTS_RUNNING : Argo Workflows running BA tests
state BA_TESTS_FAILED : BA tests failed
state BA_TESTS_PASSED : BA tests passed
state COMPLETED : PR staging deployment is successfull
state WORKFLOW_CANCELLED : Workflow cancelled
