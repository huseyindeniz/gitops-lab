# BDD notes

## Introduction

In this documentation, we've been working our way through the different layers of modern software development, starting from the top with cloud infrastructure and moving down to more specific tools and practices.
Cloud Infrastructure Management

We started by covering how to manage the infrastructure that our applications run on. This included tools like Kubernetes for handling containers, Terraform for setting up infrastructure as code, Helm for managing packages, and ArgoCD for continuous delivery. These tools help us build and maintain the cloud environments our applications need to run smoothly.
Application-Level Abstractions with Dapr

After setting up the infrastructure, we moved down a level to focus on Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime). Dapr helps developers by simplifying how different parts of an application talk to each other, manage data, and use external services. It lets us build complex, cloud-native applications more easily by hiding the complicated parts of working with different technologies.
Moving to Software Design and Development Practices

Now, we're going to go even deeper and talk about the methods we use to design and test our software. We’ll introduce Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), which builds on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD). These practices are important for making sure our software works well and meets business needs.

In the next sections, we'll briefly explain DDD and TDD, and then focus on BDD, showing how these practices work together to help us create solid, maintainable software.

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a simple but powerful approach to software development. The basic idea is to write tests for your code before you write the code itself. Here’s how it works:

1. Write a Test: First, you write a test for a small piece of functionality that you want to add. This test should fail at first because the feature isn’t built yet.
2. Write the Code: Next, you write just enough code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the Code: Finally, you clean up the code, making sure it’s well-organized and efficient, while keeping all the tests passing.

This cycle—write a test, write the code, refactor—repeats throughout the development process. TDD helps ensure that your code is reliable and does what it’s supposed to do. It also makes it easier to catch bugs early, before they become big problems.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on creating a deep understanding of the business domain in which the software operates. The idea is to align the software’s design and functionality closely with the business needs. Here are some of the key concepts:

**Core Concepts in DDD**:

- Ubiquitous Language: This is a shared language used by both developers and business stakeholders to describe the domain. Everyone uses the same terms to avoid confusion and misunderstandings.
- Domain Model: This is the representation of the key business concepts and rules in the software. It’s not just about data; it includes the behavior and interactions of different parts of the system.
- Entities: These are objects that have a unique identity, like a Customer or an Order. The identity is what makes an entity distinct from others.
- Value Objects: These are objects that don’t have an identity. Instead, they represent a concept, like Money or DateRange. Two value objects with the same values are considered equal.
- Aggregates: These are clusters of related entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit. The aggregate has a root entity, known as the Aggregate Root, that is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the entire cluster.
- Repositories: These are used to retrieve and store aggregates. They act as a collection for aggregates, allowing the application to save and fetch them from a database or other storage system.
- Bounded Contexts: A large domain is divided into smaller, more manageable sections, each with its own domain model and ubiquitous language. This helps prevent the model from becoming too complex and unmanageable.

DDD is particularly useful in complex business domains where it’s crucial to ensure that the software accurately reflects the business rules and processes.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is built on top of TDD and DDD. It combines the principles of both to focus on the behavior of the application from the user’s perspective. BDD encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define the desired behavior of the software in a way that everyone can understand.

**Key Features of BDD**:

- User Stories: In BDD, requirements are often written as user stories that describe how the software should behave in specific scenarios. These stories follow a simple format:
  Given a starting situation, When an action is taken, Then a particular outcome should occur.
- Scenarios: Each user story can have multiple scenarios, which are concrete examples of how the software should behave in different situations.
- Gherkin Language: BDD often uses Gherkin, a simple, structured language for writing down scenarios in plain English. For example:
  ```gherkin
  Scenario: User logs in successfully
  Given the user is on the login page
  When the user enters valid credentials
  Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
  ```
- Automated Tests: These scenarios are then turned into automated tests that verify the behavior of the software. This ensures that the software continues to work as expected as it evolves.

**How BDD Builds on TDD and DDD**

- From TDD: BDD takes the idea of writing tests first but focuses those tests on the behavior of the system rather than just the code itself.
- From DDD: BDD uses the domain model and ubiquitous language from DDD to ensure that the behavior described in the tests is aligned with the business domain.

By combining these practices, BDD helps ensure that the software not only works correctly but also does what the business needs it to do.
