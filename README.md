### Note on Database Migrations in Kubernetes

Handling database migrations in Kubernetes was initially challenging due to the lack of built-in mechanisms to enforce dependency order between deployments. To address this, I now use **Argo CD hooks** to run migrations before application pods are updated, ensuring the database schema is always in sync with the application.

While the solution works effectively, some limitations remain. For example, migrations are triggered with every resource update in the application, which can be time-consuming due to the need to rebuild the solution for each run. Despite this, the process is idempotent, ensuring database integrity without causing conflicts.

A potential improvement would be for EF Core migration bundles to support targeting specific migrations without requiring a full build. This would streamline the process and reduce delays, making it a valuable feature for future updates.
