# gitops-lab

GitOps Playground (K8S, Terraform, Argo CD, Helm, Github Workflows etc.)

## Goals

- **Automate and Manage Infrastructure**:  
  Leverage GitOps principles with Argo CD, Terraform, Helm, and Flux for:

  - Consistent and version-controlled infrastructure management
  - Automated image updates

- **Build a Stable CI/CD Pipeline**:  
  Create a robust pipeline with:

  - Multi-staging environments and production rollouts (blue-green and canary) using Argo Rollouts and Helm
  - Automated database migrations and easy rollback mechanisms
  - Support for GPU-based workloads and AI/ML pipelines
  - Multi-cloud deployments (AWS, AKS, GKE, DOKS) with Terraform and Kubernetes manifests

- **Enhanced Observability**:  
  Monitor deployments and performance with Prometheus and Grafana.

- **Load Testing**:  
  Validate system resilience and scalability under heavy traffic.

## Note on Database Migrations in Kubernetes

Handling database migrations in Kubernetes was initially challenging due to the lack of built-in mechanisms to enforce dependency order between deployments. To address this, I now use **Argo CD hooks** to run migrations before application pods are updated, ensuring the database schema is always in sync with the application.

While the solution works effectively, some limitations remain. For example, migrations are triggered with every resource update in the application, which can be time-consuming due to the need to rebuild the solution for each run. Despite this, the process is idempotent, ensuring database integrity without causing conflicts.

A potential improvement would be for EF Core migration bundles to support targeting specific migrations without requiring a full build. This would streamline the process and reduce delays, making it a valuable feature for future updates.
